# Vendor-specific MIDlet attributes

### Nokia
#### Series 60
| Attribute | Description | Values
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------
| Nokia-MIDlet-Category | Destination folder for MIDlet installation. _Since: S60 2nd Edition_ | `Application` , `Game`
| Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size | Specifies the screen for which the MIDlet was designed. This is used to adapt the MIDlet for full-screen mode on a mobile device. Scaling applies to full screen LCDUI Canvases only. _Since: S60 3rd Edition_ | `(Width),(Height)`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Target-Display-Size | Specifies the target size for the MIDlet. This usually same as target deviceâ€™s screen size. This attribute is usually used in conjunction with `Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size`. Scaling applies to full screen LCDUI Canvases only. _Since: S60 3rd Edition_ |  `(Width),(Height)`
|  Nokia-Scalable-Icon  /  Nokia-Scalable-Icon-MIDlet-`(n)`  | Specifies scalable (SVG) MIDlet icon support. For MIDlet suites, the attribute `Nokia-Scalable-Icon-MIDlet-n` specifies the icon for MIDlet `n`. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `(Scalable icon path)`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-UID-`(n)`  | Predefined UID for a MIDlet. UID can be from following ranges: Unprotected range 0xA0000000 - 0xAFFFFFFF , Protected range 0x20000000 - 0x2FFFFFFF , Test range 0xE0000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF. In the case the UID is from protected range, the MIDlet Suite must be signed and the UID must be specified in both the JAD and the JAR manifest file. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `(range)`
|  Nokia-UI-Enhancement  | Comma separated list, where the following attributes are allowed: `CanvasHasBackground`: Displays the default theme background image as a normal mode Canvas (not full screen) component background instead of the default white background. If the MIDlet does not render all the pixels of a given clip region in the paint method, the theme background is shown. `MusicKeysSupported`: Allow acquisition of media key events from the MIDlet. `PopUpTextBox`: Sets TextBox as a pop-up TextBox. `FullScreenTextBox`: Replaces the default pop-up TextBox with a full-screen TextBox. `IgnoreProfilesBasedSoundMuting`: Disabling automatic audio muting for the Meeting and Silent profiles.  _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `(attribute),(attribute),...` where valid attributes are: `CanvasHasBackground` ,  `MusicKeysSupported` , `PopUpTextBox` , `FullScreenTextBox` , `MusicKeysSupported`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Canvas-Scaling-Orientation-Switch  | Specifies whether MIDlet allows change of original MIDlet size (`Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size`) orientation when switching from portrait to landscape mode. After resolution switch the MIDlet is notified via sizeChanged() function of LCDUI Canvas. `Nokia-MIDlet-Canvas-Scaling-Orientation-Switch` is always used together with `Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size`. As `Nokia-MIDlet-Original-Display-Size` is used to indicate a fixed resolution that full screen Canvas content of the MIDlet is designed for, then additionally specifying `Nokia-MIDlet-Canvas-Scaling-Orientation-Switch` to `true` indicates that the MIDlet can also support the given resolution in both portrait and landscape resolutions. Behavior of combining `Nokia-MIDlet-Canvas-Scaling-Orientation-Switch: true` and setting `Nokia-MIDlet-Target-Display-Size` is undefined. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `true` , `false`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-No-Exit  | Prevents the MIDlet from closing via pressing the End key. Instead of closing the MIDlet it is put to the background. The MIDlet can be still closed from the list of open applications. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `true` , `false`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Flip-Close  | Specifies MIDlet behaviour on flip-close event. If value is pause, pauseApp() is called if flip is closed. If flip then is opened, startApp() is called. By default the attribute value is run and therefore pauseApp() and startApp() are not called when flip is closed. If MIDlet is already in background it does not get any notification about flip close event. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `pause` , `run`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Background-Event  | Specifies MIDlet behavior to background event. If value is `pause`, pauseApp() is called if on to background event takes place. If on to foreground event takes place, startApp() is called. By default the attribute value is `run` and therefore pauseApp() and startApp() are not called when on to background event takes place. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `pause` , `run`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Block-Uninstall  | Prevents uninstallation of the MIDlet Suite if value of this attribute is true. Only Manufacturer or Operator signed applications are able to use this attribute. This attribute must be specified in the JAR manifest file. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `true` , `false`
| Nokia-MIDlet-S60-Selection-Key-Compatibility | This attribute changes the default Selection key behavior in Canvas and CustomItem elements. By default normal mode Canvas and CustomItem do not get low level key events even if there is no CommandListener defined. This attribute changes the default Selection key behaviour regarding Commands in normal mode Canvas and CustomItem. If value of attribute is true, no Commands are mapped to Selection key, instead the low level key event (-5) is triggered. Note that in a full screen mode Canvas without any Commands and CommandListener defined, this feature does not have any effect as low level key events are triggered from all softkeys in any case. _Since: S60 3rd Edition FP 2_ | `true` , `false`
| Nokia-Forward-Lock | Specifies whether the MIDlet suite in the MIDlet Message is installed as forward-locked. Forward-locked means that the MIDlet suite JAR file from the MIDlet Message is DRM-encrypted during installation. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `true` , `false`
| Nokia-MIDlet-App-Orientation | Allows MIDlet to force either portrait or landscape UI orientation. The orientation is only fixed on devices that support the specific layout. _Since: S60 5th Edition_ | `portrait` , `landscape`
| Nokia-MIDlet-Delete-Confirm-`(locale)` | Specifies the localized confirmation prompt shown when the user selects to remove the MIDlet or MIDlet suite. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `(message)`
| Nokia-MIDlet-Launch-Params | Specifies the set of parameters that the application supports when launched using launchapp: or javaapp: URI platform request. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `(Comma separated list of property names)`
| Nokia-MIDlet-Name-`(locale)` | The localized name of the MIDlet suite for the specified `locale`. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `(name)`
| Nokia-MIDlet-`(n)`-`(locale)` | The localized name of the MIDlet `n` of a MIDlet suite. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `(name)`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad  | Specifies the on-screen keypad for a Canvas application. This attribute is valid only in touch-enabled devices that have limited physical key availability. _Since: S60 5th Edition_ | `no` , `gameactions` _(UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, GAME_A, GAME_B GAME_C and GAME_D)_ , `navigationkeys` _(UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and FIRE)_
|  Nokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Softkeys-Position  | Defines where softkeys are placed on the screen when using the on-screen keypad on devices that have no physical softkeys. _Since: S60 5th Edition (Java Runtime 1.4)_ | `right` , `bottom`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Splash-Screen-Image | Defines the custom start-up screen ("splash screen") used by the MIDlet. This attribute can also be used to define multiple custom start-up screens for the device to choose from or to disable ("suppress") the start-up screen for the MIDlet. _Since: Symbian^3 (Java Runtime 2.1)_ | `(image),(image),...` , `suppress`
|  Nokia-MIDlet-Tap-Detection-Options  | Sets the size of tap detection area and tap time-out on Touch UI devices. If the pointer stays pressed within the detection area and does not surpass the time-out value, the event is considered a single tap. If the pointer leaves the detection area or the time-out passes, drag events start being generated. The detection area is a rectangle, measured in twips. The entered value is half the length of one side of the rectangle. _Since: S60 5th Edition (Java Runtime 1.4)_ | `(detection rectangle size),(timeout)`
